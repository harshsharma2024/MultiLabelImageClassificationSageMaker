Multi-Label Image Classification with SageMaker

Overview
This Jupyter notebook provides end-to-end functionality for multi-label image classification using Amazon SageMaker.This repository contains code for a multi-label image classification model trained on a dataset with 131 different labels. The model achieves approximately 96% validation accuracy after training for 1000 epochs. The notebook covers model training, deployment as an API, and making predictions on new images.

Functionality
1. Model Training
Execute the cells in the notebook to train the multi-label image classification model. Key hyperparameters, such as the number of classes, epochs, mini-batch size, and model architecture, can be adjusted within the notebook.

2. Deploying the Model as an API
Run the cells related to deploying the model as an API using SageMaker. Ensure you have the correct IAM role and model artifacts specified.

3. Making Predictions
Execute the cells for making predictions on new images using the deployed SageMaker endpoint. Provide the path to the image you want to classify.

Hyperparameters Configuration
Adjust the hyperparameters directly within the notebook to customize the training process. Key hyperparameters include:

num_classes: Number of classes in the classification task.
epochs: Number of training epochs.
mini_batch_size: Size of mini-batches during training.
num_layers: Number of layers in the neural network architecture.
use_pretrained_model: Flag to use a pre-trained model.
... (other hyperparameters as needed)
Data Channels Configuration
In the notebook, data channels are configured for SageMaker's training input. Ensure that the paths to your training and validation datasets are correctly specified.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can install them within the notebook using:

python
Copy code
!pip install -r requirements.txt
Note
This notebook assumes input images are in JPEG format. Adjust the ContentType parameter in the inference script based on your image type.
Customize the code as needed based on your specific dataset and requirements.
